# Python Sudoku solver

Usage: python sudoku1.py
expects sudoku1.csv file in same dir
takes csv file (comma separated) with sudoku problem see 'normal_sudoku1.xlsx'
export csv file from this. see sudoku1.csv & sudoku2.csv sample problem files.

solution works with easy to intermediate levels of difficulty
but can not solve high difficully levels.
I may re-visit later at some stage.
